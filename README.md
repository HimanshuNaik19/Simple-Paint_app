# Simple Paint App (Plain JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas)

A lightweight paint app built with only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no third‑party libraries). It lets you draw filled circles by clicking and dragging on the canvas, shows Hit/Miss on click, and deletes a circle on double‑click.

## Features

- Draw circles on the canvas by click + drag (radius = drag distance)
- Auto‑assigned fill colors for each new circle
- Click (no drag) shows a transient "Hit" or "Miss" near the pointer
- Double‑click a circle to delete it (topmost circle is picked if overlapping)
- Reset button clears the canvas and removes all circles
- Responsive canvas and HiDPI‑aware rendering
- Plain JavaScript only – no frameworks or libraries (e.g., no jQuery, no KineticJS)

## Project Structure

```
.
├─ index.html            # Page layout, inline minimal styles, canvas + Reset
├─ css/
│  └─ style.css          # Base boilerplate styles (from HTML5 Boilerplate)
├─ js/
│  └─ app.js             # All paint app logic (drawing, hit test, deletion, reset)
├─ img/                  # (empty placeholder)
├─ webpack.*.js          # Present in template; not required to run this app
└─ package*.json         # Present in template; not required to run this app
```

## How to Run

- Easiest: open `index.html` directly in your browser.
- Alternatively, serve the folder using any static file server. (Not required.)

No build step is needed.

## Usage

- Click and drag on the canvas to create a filled circle.
- Click without dragging to check if you clicked over a circle:
  - Shows "Hit" if there is a circle under the cursor, otherwise "Miss".
- Double‑click a circle to delete it (topmost first if circles overlap).
- Click the **Reset** button to clear the canvas.

## Implementation Notes

- The app stores circles in memory as `{ x, y, r, fill }` and redraws the canvas when the list changes.
- Colors are generated by rotating the HSL hue for visual variety.
- The canvas resizes to its CSS size and uses `window.devicePixelRatio` for crisp rendering on HiDPI displays.
- All interaction is implemented with native DOM and Canvas APIs.

## Browser Support

- Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- No special polyfills required.

## Constraints

- Per assignment requirements, this app uses only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- No third‑party libraries or frameworks are used in the application logic.

## Notes for Submission

- Both Module 1 and Module 2 are implemented within this single application:
  - Module 1: Draw circles by dragging, auto‑fill color, Reset button.
  - Module 2: Hit/Miss on click, double‑click to delete a circle.
- You can zip the project and upload to your preferred drive (Google Drive/OneDrive) and share as instructed.

## Optional Tweaks

- Fixed canvas size vs. responsive canvas (adjust in `index.html` `.canvas-wrap` sizing rules).
- Color palette (adjust the HSL hue step in `js/app.js`).
- Border/visual style adjustments in the inline styles inside `index.html`.

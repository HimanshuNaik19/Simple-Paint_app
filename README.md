# Simple Paint App (Plain JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas)

A lightweight paint app built with only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you draw filled circles by clicking and dragging on the canvas, shows Hit/Miss on click, and deletes a circle on double‑click.

## Features

- Draw circles on the canvas by click + drag (radius = drag distance)
- Auto‑assigned fill colors for each new circle
- Click (no drag) shows a transient "Hit" or "Miss" near the pointer
- Double‑click a circle to delete it (topmost circle is picked if overlapping)
- Reset button clears the canvas and removes all circles
- Responsive canvas and HiDPI‑aware rendering

## Project Structure

```
.
├─ index.html            # Page layout, inline minimal styles, canvas + Reset
├─ js/
│  └─ app.js             # All paint app logic (drawing, hit test, deletion, reset)
```

## How to Run

- open `index.html` directly in your browser.

No build step is needed.

## Usage

- Click and drag on the canvas to create a filled circle.
- Click without dragging to check if you clicked over a circle:
  - Shows "Hit" if there is a circle under the cursor, otherwise "Miss".
- Double‑click a circle to delete it (topmost first if circles overlap).
- Click the **Reset** button to clear the canvas.

## Implementation Notes

- The app stores circles in memory as `{ x, y, r, fill }` and redraws the canvas when the list changes.
- Colors are generated by rotating the HSL hue for visual variety.
- The canvas resizes to its CSS size and uses `window.devicePixelRatio` for crisp rendering on HiDPI displays.
